# qrscanner

This is branch to replicate issue I am facing with react-native-permission, in android. I am facing this issue even after troubleshooting the available solutions.

I request to have a look.

In this Code repo, I am trying to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-qrcode-scanner,
I have been using same steps as mentioned in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCjQKWFHyYs&t=65s

I am couple of issues
1.) Error: react-native-permissions: NativeModule.RNPermissions is null.
2.) Invariant Violation: "main" has not been registered. This can happen if:
* Metro (the local dev server) is run from the wrong folder.

I've seen comments that we can not run using expo, can anyone suggest how this emulator working on provided video link?
